#### Given a string, find its first non-repeating character

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it. For example, if the input string is “aaabcccdeeef”, then the output should be ‘b’ and if the input string is “abcabcabc”, then the output should be ‘_’.

#### Problem 2

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division? - included but no O(n) solution

#### Problem 216

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a number in Roman numeral format, convert it to decimal.

The values of Roman numerals are as follows:
```
{
    'M': 1000,
    'D': 500,
    'C': 100,
    'L': 50,
    'X': 10,
    'V': 5,
    'I': 1
}
```

In addition, note that the Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for numbers such as `IV` and `XL`.

For the input `XIV`, for instance, you should return `14`.
